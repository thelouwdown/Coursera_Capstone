With this relocation, hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of people will have to uplift their lives and move to another city.\n\nBased on this [forbes article](https://fortune.com/longform/brexit-amsterdam-the-new-london-europe-companies/) Amsterdam could be the 'new London'. If employees are forced to move from the one city to the other, the big question is: which neighborhoods should these soon-to-be ex-Londoners choose to move to in Amsterdam?\n\nBased on Foursquare data, I aim to cluster Amsterdam and London neighborhoods based on similarity. So if you love your neighborhood in London and want something similar in Amsterdam, this is your go-to guide."

Lastly, I will use the Folium library to visualize the neighborhoods in Amsterdam and London and their emerging clusters."
